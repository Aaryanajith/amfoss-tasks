# Programming

This is by far the task I was mostly working on, even coming from a CS background some of the questions really made me go crazy and i had only fully completed few questions the rest i just attempted.
The most deceiving part of the task is most questions show the difficulty as easy but in reality definitely not so easy ðŸ¥²
