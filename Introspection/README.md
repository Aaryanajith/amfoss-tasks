# Why must we choose you?




I love coding, and while coding something I don’t know how time flies by. I started to learn coding from class 11 and it was python and I loved it, it felt so natural to me and I enjoyed doing it after that when my classes got over, I took a beginner course for C++ and even though it was different and complex than python I enjoyed doing it. Through this I only want to say that coding is my passion and I’m always eager to learn more about coding and technology. That’s why you should choose me.

# What is your plan for the next 6 months?




For the next 6 months i plan to learn many new things, learn more about Git Hub, linux and many other things. Hopefully participate in competitions, basically improve myself as a coder.

# How would you contribute back to the club?




I, like how my seniors helped me will help all the aspiring juniors who are passionate about coding, help them unlock the vast multitude of knowledge about coding and help to push the name AMfoss to even bigger heights.

# Do you have any feedback on the selection process?




The selection process was very good, for me this is the first time I'm getting exposure to all this and I enjoyed the whole process. I guess for the majority of people attempting this they will all feel very intrested by the process and the atmosphere of the team.
