# About Me

Hi mentors, I'm Aaryan A from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, currently pursuing my B-Tech in ECE. I'm currently in S1 in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, School Of Engineering.I came to know about Amfoss randomly while scrolling through the clubs page in Amrita website and the same moment I decided to shift to Amritapuri campus as I really got intrested in the club. I studied python in my 11Th and 12Th classes and that really gave birth to a passion for coding in me. I'm a really good hardworker and smartworker and I enjoy doing what I like to do and when I do it I don't feel it as a work that I have to do and I enjoy doing it.

# My Views About The Tasks

I would say the tasks were not very easy and myself coming from a CS background found many of the tasks very hard at first but eventually enjoyed the whole process.The point of the tasks were very well fulfilled as each and every task gave me a taste and exposure to most of the technologies that are out there and gave us a door to `Free And Open Source`. Overall I enjoyed the whole process and all the mentors were very supportive and the environment given to me was very great. Lastly thank you for providing me an adventurous and eventfull journey.
