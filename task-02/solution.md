# Terminal Hunt

This was the first task I attempted and at first I found it difficult but later i enjoyed doing this task, this was a really good task.
# Terminal commands


First to get all the required files on our system I forked the repo and cloned it, for that I used 'git clone' and cloned the repo into my system.

# Step 1
Then to create a directory called solution I used 'mkdir solution' which makes a directory solution.

# Part 1 and 2
Then I did the first two parts with help from google 

# Part 3
For the third part the the hint was in the commit log so i used command 'git log' to open the commit log which contains all the commits made to that repo. Got the hint for the third part from there. 

To commit all the work we did to the main branch I used 'git add .' which adds all the new changes made, then to commit it to main branch I used 'git commit -m "The commit message"'and then to push it into the repo I used 'git push' which pushed all the work I did into the repo.

# Part 4
For this part the file is on a different branch so to see all the local and remote braanches of the repo I used 'git branch -a'. To switch to a new branch we use command 'git checkout<branch_name>' this will create a local copy of the branch.

To go to the main branch I used the command 'git checkout main' and to merge the branch with file to the main brqnch 'git merge<branch_name>'

Finally I concatenated all the parts and opened the pdf.
