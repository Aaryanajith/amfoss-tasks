#  Krypto Scrapper

Literally I spent a whole week for this task and i really wanted to give up, but some thing didnt let me do it and finally after sleepless nights and starvation I completed it. The last error which I was stuck on was a typo and i wanted to kick myself hard ðŸ˜­. Anyway finishing it was like a huge weight lifted off me, nonetheless I enjoyed this adventure of a task.
